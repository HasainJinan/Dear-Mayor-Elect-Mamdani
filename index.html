                        Congratulations on becoming mayor-elect of New York City! Your unwavering stance on making New York more affordable for its residents and improving the quality of life for the marginalized and unheard communities is the first fresh breath of air this city has seen in a while. While we are only in high school, soon to be college, we hope that our voice, with your help, reaches the lower sections of the US Government and beyond, highlighting the problems and struggles that families see in New York City and making life easier for these families. However, although greater New York City and beyond is our goal, the truth is that New York City is too expansive and too diverse of a city for us students to cover all of its highs and lows. Thus, we chose to use a specific neighborhood, Ridgewood Queens, and focused on bringing to light the problems in that neighborhood and the potential solutions for it with the hopes that this will expand to fixing the issues throughout New York City and even Greater New York.

                    <h2 id="scrollspyHeading2">Ridgewood And Its Problems</h2>
                    <p class="fs-5">
                        Ridgewood, located in ZIP code 11385, is a historically working class neighborhood with a mix of older buildings and a predominantly renter-occupied population. The median household income is around $87,365 per year, but with rents soaring to $3,200 per month - up from about $1,543 just a few years ago, leaving many residents struggling to keep up. This surge in rent has been exacerbated by a dramatic decline in rent-stabilized units, which fell over by 65% between 2019 and 2021, leaving many vulnerable tenants at risk of displacement. As housing costs rise and long-time residents are pushed out, Ridgewood faces a growing divide between those who can afford the area’s new rents and those who cannot, threatening the community’s cultural fabric and stability.

                    <h3 id="scrollspyHeading3">Our Potential Solutions</h3>
                    <p class="fs-5">
                        To address some of the problems highlighted above, we devised 3 policy solutions to potentially fix some of the issues mentioned above. These policy suggestions aren’t meant to be followed to the T, but rather serve as suggestions for changes that would benefit the families of Ridgewood.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="container d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center p-4" style="border: solid 2px; border-radius: 20px; background-color: aliceblue;">
                    <div class="fs-6 row">
                        <p class="col align-self-center no-margin">
                            The first policy change we devised was an expansion or strengthening of the number of rent-stabilized apartments as the number has dropped from ~6,228 to ~2,149, as claimed by <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/03/01/ridgewood-rent-stabilization-substantial-rehabilitation/">The City news outlet</a>. An increase in rent-stabilized apartments would increase the number of apartments whose rent is monitored by councils, keeping the rent of more buildings low and affordable for families. Along with this, adding or improving incentives given to landlords that make rented apartments more affordable would encourage prioritizing affordability and make it easier for lower income families to live in Ridgewood.
                        </p>
        
                        <p class="col align-self-center no-margin">
                            The second policy change we came up with was creating a program/programs that would make it easier for long-term renters/working class residents to collectively purchase buildings. This program would provide low-interest municipal loans or matching funds for such tenant/worker co‑ops, making it easier for residents to buy into shared co-ops. This will ideally lower the obscenely high percentage of renters in Ridgewood while also insulating residents against rent spikes. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <div class="col align-self-center no-margin">
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                                The third and final policy change we came up with to solve issues in Ridgewood was enforcing a higher living wage and expanding programs to support working class families. This policy change seeks to enforce a standard wage around New York City as a whole, not just Ridgewood, but in doing so, will significantly improve both the ability for lower-income families to afford basic necessities such as food and shelter, but also push many families that are in poverty out of it.
                            </p>
                            <p class="no-margin">
                                This will also help many families that are currently struggling to pay for their living expenses to be able to live without feeling like they are risking their livelihoods. Additionally, investing in local job training and job placement programs would allow residents to have access to these jobs with a higher minimum wage without having to leave the borough.
                            </p>

                    <div class="no-indent fs-5">
                        While these are far from the only issues Ridgewood experiences, these are the issues that we found to be the most pressing and prone to worsen in the coming years. Again, these are only suggestions of actions and courses you can take regarding making our city more affordable since you are more knowledgeable than us in policy-making and the law. However, these serve to highlight issues within notable communities such as Ridgewood, and families in NYC would appreciate the benefits that would arise from those issues being addressed.

                    <h4 id="scrollspyHeading4">What We Hope To See In Our Communities In The Future</h4>
                        <p class="fs-5">The city’s success in addressing housing instability in neighborhoods like Ridgewood will depend on the policies you choose to enact. With gentrification threatening to displace long-time residents, there is a pressing need for city leadership that balances growth with the preservation of communities. By implementing strong rent protections, supporting tenant ownership, and linking housing policy to broader economic reforms, you can help ensure that Ridgewood remains a diverse, affordable, and vibrant neighborhood. While this website explains the challenges within Ridgewood and changes that would potentially fix those issues, the greater goal is New York City as a whole, and this is just the first step. The challenges are great, but so are the opportunities for positive change, and your leadership could make a lasting difference in the lives of New Yorkers across the city.
